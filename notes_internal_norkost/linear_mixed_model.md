> Understand the interpretation of estimates



# lme4

### Random intercept 

This should be the use case for NORKOST - we do not care so much about the change over time (slope), only the avearge within each measurement should be of interest

- fixed effects - same point estimates with lm, slightly changed se
- random effects - the variable (id): variance, sd + residual
  - guess no estimate since all ~ N(0, sd)
